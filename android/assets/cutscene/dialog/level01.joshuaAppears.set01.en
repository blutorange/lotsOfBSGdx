But that's beside the point right now!
Hey, Joshua, just where are we?
What is this strange place?

Since I came here I did investigate the
immediate area, but did not find anything.
However, I am certain there is some
mysterious power at work here.

This spring looks different as well,
there seems to be something special
about this place.

>>EventTextbox

  Speaker Joshua
  Face Serious
  Text EOF
Yes, that is my impression as well. The sign
near the river said it was located in the
Unbright World. Does that mean we are lost
in the dark without a way out?

That star sign on the ground looks suspicious as.
well. With its round shape it almost feels
as if it absorbed our energy...

So basically we do not know much about that
power, or what this place is. Right know,
we do not know much at all...

If you don't know either, I guess there's
nothing to be done about it for now.
And let me ask, why don't you float?

What? Float?ã€€

>>EventTextbox

Look, I'm floating in the air!
After we got separated, I left the city. Soon after
I must have fallen unconscious and when I awakened
I was here, floating ever since.

Well, now that you mention it, you are right,
you are floating indeed.
Are you on a diet again?
EOF

>>EventTextbox
  Speaker Estelle
  Face ANGRY
  TransitionIn

  Text EOF
No, of couse not! Think what you will, but as a Bracer I
need to eat all I can! Anyways, when I'm thinking about
taking a step forward, my body just moves there on
its own. While floating.
EOF

>>EventTextbox
  Speaker Joshua

We need to investigate this carefully later.
For now it does not seem to pose any immediate
danger and there might be some places you can
only reach floating. Bear with it for now.

>>EventTextbox

Until later then, Estelle. We will meet up later.

>>EventTextbox

  Face CONTEMPLATING
  TransitionIn
  Text EOF
No, it is better to split up. We can cover a larger
area and find a way out of here more quickly. The 
enemies of this area are not too strong, you should
be able to handle them by yourself.
EOF

>>EventTextbox

I saw a Combat Cube to the north of the
city gates. Collect it and you should be able
to eliminate them.

Oh well, too bad. But if you say it like that, I've got
to do my best as well! How hard can it be to beat a few
enemies? Just leave it to me!!

>>EventTextbox

Before I forget, I need to warn you about
the cliffs to the north. A strong enemy hides
there waiting for prey. I suggest you avoid
approaching the cliffs unarmed.

I am off. See you later.
